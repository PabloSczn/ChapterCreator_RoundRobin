# Chapter_Creator_RoundRobin

Uses Round Robin algorithm and Shell Scripting to create a chapter of a book, allowing the user to read the chapter, add text or remove custom text.

To accomplish this, the script loads the files from Docker1, Docker2 and Docker3 in three different dockers and sorts them using the Shortest Job Next and First Come First Served algorithms.

Docker1, Docker2 and Docker3 folders must be in the home directory
